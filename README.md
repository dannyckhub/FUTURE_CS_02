# FUTURE_CS_02
Security Alert Monitoring &amp; Incident Response

SIEM Incident Response with Elastic Stack

This project demonstrates security alert monitoring, incident analysis, and response reporting using the Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana, Filebeat).

It simulates real-world SOC analyst tasks by ingesting sample logs, detecting suspicious activities, classifying incidents, and drafting remediation recommendations.

ðŸ”§ Tools Used

Elasticsearch (7.x) â†’ Stores & indexes log data

Kibana â†’ Log visualization & dashboarding

Filebeat â†’ Log shipper (ingests logs into Elasticsearch)

Sample Logs â†’ Authentication logs, system events

SIEM Methodology â†’ Alert analysis, classification, remediation

âš¡ Setup & Execution

Start Elasticsearch & Kibana

bin\elasticsearch
bin\kibana


Configure Filebeat (point to sample_logs/ directory)

filebeat.inputs:
  - type: log
    paths:
      - C:\ELK\sample_logs\*.log


Run Filebeat

filebeat -e


Access Kibana
ðŸ‘‰ http://127.0.0.1:5601

Go to Discover tab â†’ search logs, detect anomalies.

ðŸ”Ž Sample Incident Analysis

ðŸ“Œ Example log detected:

Aug 11 20:00:01 testhost sshd[1234]: Failed password for invalid user admin from 10.1.2.3 port 5001 ssh2


âœ… Analysis:

Multiple failed SSH login attempts from external IP â†’ brute-force attack attempt.

ðŸ“Œ Incident Classification:

Category: Authentication Attack

Severity: Medium â†’ High (if repeated)

ðŸ“Œ Remediation Recommendations:

Block IP 10.1.2.3 at firewall

Enable account lockout policy

Monitor for further brute-force attempts

Consider MFA for SSH access
